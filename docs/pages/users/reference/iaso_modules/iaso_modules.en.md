# Modules

IASO is organized according to Modules, which are groups of functionalities which can be added up depending on the use case to cover. Here are the Modules available in IASO:

## Data collection functionalities
- Manage data collection forms (XLS forms) and their related data submissions
- Manage geographic data (import/export of geo data from Excel, DHIS2 or Geopackages, manage the Organizations Units and their hierarchy)
- Monitor the data collection process with the completeness statistics table and map
- Manage users and their permissions and geographies, user roles and teams
- Create mobile application(s) IDs and manage related features options

## Georegistry 
- Import several data sources from Excel, DHIS2 or Geopackages, compare and merge them as needed
- Visualize on a dynamic map data collected at the different levels of the hierarchy (e.g. Country, Region, District, facility)
- Validate changes on Organization Units (Name, Type, GPS coordinates, opening/closing dates) submitted from the field via the mobile application
- Validate data submitted via data collection forms that are linked to specific Organization Units types, called "Reference forms"

##Payments
- Based on the validated proposed changes per user, generate payment lots to send to Mobile Money provider
- Indicate the status of the payments lots (pending, sent to Mobile Money provider, etc.)

## DHIS2 bi-directional integration 
- Manage the mappings with DHIS2 data elements for import/export of data

## Planning
-  Plan ahead your data collection activities by creating a planning with a set timeframe, geography, data collection forms and teams
- Assign data collection tasks to teams and users from the map-based interface available on the web
- Once tasks have been assigned, the mobile application users on the field will only see the forms that have been assigned to them

## Entities
- Entities are items that can move from a geography to another, for instance a person, a pallet of goods, or other
- Entities can be created from the mobile application and then managed from the web application
- Find the entities duplicates by using the web application interface and make the decision to merge two similar entities or not
- Assign workflows to entity types, enabling specific data collection forms to open according to previously given answers
