# POST /api/orgunits/changes/?app_id=..

API used to create or modify an OrgUnit with validation (see feature flags)
When creating an OrgUnit, the client doesn't know the ID or the OrgUnit was not created yet and we might want to apply 
some changes still. Therefore, the IDs can be either the DB id or the UUID generated by the client.
Changes that are not provided are considered not being part of the change request.

## Permissions

User must be authenticated.

## Query parameters

- app_id: String - Optional, project for which this is created.

## Body

```json

  "new_name": "String? - Name of the OrgUnit, may be null or omitted.",
  "new_org_unit_type_id": "Int? - id of the OrgUnitType, may be null or omitted",
  "new_groups": "Array of Group ids? - can be empty, null or omitted. Empty means we want to remove all values",
