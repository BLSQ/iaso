for status monitoring), you can set the environment variable `MAINTENANCE_MODE` to the value `"true"`

The `LEARN_MORE_URL` environment variable is used to specify a URL that will be displayed on the login page. If set, users can click on a "Know More" link or the logo to visit this URL. If `LEARN_MORE_URL` is not set, the logo will not be clickable, and the link will not be displayed.

```
LEARN_MORE_URL
