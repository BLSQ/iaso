Introduction
============

Iaso is a georegistry and data collection web platform structured around
trees of organization units (also known a master lists)

The main tasks it allows accomplishing are:

-   Data collection using [XLSForm](https://xlsform.org/) forms linked
    to org units through a mobile application.
-   Import, comparison and merging of multiple Org Units' trees, both
    through a web application and an API allowing manipulation through
    data science tools like [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
-   Validation of received data for Org Units' trees and forms.
-   Exports of the Org Units' trees and form data, either in csv, xlsx,
    [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) or through an api.

Long Intro
----------
Iaso is a platform created to support geo-rich data collection efforts, mainly in public health in
emerging countries. The key feature that it supports is that any survey is linked to an organizational
unit that is part of a canonical hierarchy. Each one of these org. units can have a location and a
territory. The mobile data collection tool can be used to enrich this hierarchy with additional GPS
coordinates, names corrections, etc ... which can then be validated by officials of the organizations
in question through the web dashboard. This leads to continuous improvements of the geographic references
available through the routine activities already planned. e.g. locating and registering health facilities while
investigating malaria cases.

The tool has been used in multiple data collection efforts, notably in the domain of Performance Based Financing
of health services in D.R. Congo, Niger, Cameroon and Nigeria and is more and more used to compare multiple
versions of official organisational hierarchies when a canonical one needs to be rebuilt (for example
 to rebuild a school map for DRC). To help for this type of project,
we provide location selection interfaces, multiple levels of audits and an API open to data scientists for analysis
and mass edits.

Iaso has been created by the company [Bluesquare](https://bluesquarehub.com/), specialised in software and services
for public health, and has become open source under the MIT License in November 2020.

Iaso is made of a white labeled Android application using Java/Kotlin, reusing large parts of the ODK projects,
and a web platform programmed using Python/GeoDjango on top of PostGIS. Frontend is mainly React/Leaflet.
One of the aims is the ease of integration with other platforms. We already have csv and geopackage imports and
exports and target easy integration with OSM.

Structure
---------

This repository contains Iaso frontend and backend, respectively in Python Django and JS React. They interact
via an API implemented via Django rest framework, all data is stored in Postgresql or the media/ directory.

A companion mobile app for Android allow submitting Form and creating org unit.

Form can also be filled in a web interface via the Enketo companion service. Both Iaso and Enketo need to be
configured to work together. It is possible to run an Enketo service locally, see Enketo section below.

More documentation on the Front End part is present in
[hat/assets/README.rst](hat/assets/README.rst)


Data Model / Glossary
---------------------

Some terminology in Iaso come from DHIS2, some from ODK which mean that it can be a bit confusing.
We will highlight some equivalences that might help you.

This is not (yet) the complete Data Model, but here are the main concepts/model in Iaso:

* Iaso is multi tenant. Tenant are called and represented by the model `Account`. It represents roughly one client org or country. It also represents the natural limit of right for a user.
* Each Django's User has a linked Iaso `Profile` that link it to an `Account` and store extra parameters for the user.
* Each tenant can have multiple `Project`. Projects are linked to one android version App via the `app_id`. We use the link to control what a user can see from that app.
* `DHIS2` is a standard server application and web UI in the industry to handle Health Data. Iaso can import and export data (forms and org unit) to it.
* `OrgUnit` (Organizational Unit) is a Node of the GeoRegistry tree. e.g a particular Country, City or Hospital. each belonging to each other via a `parent` relationship.
   * They can have a type `OrgUnitType` e.g. Country, City, Hospital
   * they can belong to multiple `Group`, e.g. Urban Region or Campaign 2017
   * DHIS2 has the concept of `Group` but not `Type` so when importing from a DHIS2 Instance all the type will be Unknown and OrgUnit will belong to group like `Clinic`
   * `GroupSet` are Group of group. Used when we export Group to DHIS2
  * OrgUnit may have a position in space, it can be an area, the  `geom` field is then used, or just a Point, the `location` field is then used.
    * It's technically possible to have both
    * a OrgUnit may have no geographical info
    * a OrgUnit may geographically be outside its parent.
* `DataSource` links OrgUnit and Group imported from the same source, e.g a DHIS2 instance, a CSV or a GeoPackage.
   * A `source_ref` on the imported instance is used to keep the reference from the original source, so we can match it again in the future (when updating the import or exporting it back)
   * `SourceVersion` is used to keep each version separated. e.g each time we import from DHIS2 we create a new version.
   * OrgUnit (for their parent) and Group should only reference other OrgUnit and Group in the same version. (This is not enforced everywhere yet)
* `Task` are asynchronous function that will be run by a background worker in production. eg: Importing Data from DHIS2. see Worker section below for more info.
* `Form` is the definition of a Form (list of question and their presentation).
    * The model contain the metadata, the actual definition is done in a `XSLForm` as an attached file.
    * Form are linked to one or more Project. This is used to know which Form are presented in the Mobile App.
    * Form can have multiple versions
* `Instance` or Form instance is the `Submission` of a form. A form that has actually been filed by a user.
    * Instance can be GeoTagged and/or linked to a OrgUnit
    * Note: We are moving to use Submission everywhere in the UI, but it is still in progress. please submit PR.
    * Submission cannot be done via the Iaso UI itself but through Enketo or the Mobile App.
* `APIImport` are used to log some request from the mobile app so we can replay them in case of error. See [vector_control Readme](hat/vector_control/README.md)
* `audit.Modification` are used to keep a history of modification on some models (mainly orgunit). See [audit readme](hat/audit/README.md)
* `Link` are used to match two OrgUnit (in different source or not) that should be the same in the real world, but we don't have an unique identifier for, they have a confidence score.
They are usually generated via `AlgorithmRun`, or the matching is done in a Notebook and uploaded via the API.
  

Development environment
=======================

Setup
-----


A running local instance for development can be spin up via docker-compose which will install and
configure all dep in separate container. As such your computer should only need:

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
-   [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

If docker-compose give you trouble, make sure it can connect to the
__docker daemon__.

A `pgdata-iaso` folder, containing the database data, will be created in the parent directory of the git repository

### 1. Environment variables

The docker-compose.yml file contains sensible defaults for the Django
application.

Other environment variables can be provided by a [.env
file](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file).

As a starting point, you can copy the sample .env.dist file and edit it
to your needs.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
cp .env.dist .env
```

> **note**
>
> all the commands here need to be run in the project directory, where you cloned the repository


### 2. Build the containers

This will build and download the containers.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose build
```

### 3. Start the database

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose up db
```

### 4. Run migrations

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose run --rm iaso manage migrate
```

### 5. Start the server

To start all the containers (backend, frontend, db)

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose up
```

The web server should be reachable at `http://localhost:8081` (you
should see a login form).

The `docker-compose.yml` file describes the setup of the containers. See section below for a lit

### 6. Create a superuser

To login to the app or the Django admin, a superuser needs to be created
with:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

You can now login in the admin at `http://localhost:8081/admin`.

Then additional users with custom groups and permissions can be added
through the Django admin or loaded via fixtures.

### 7. Create and import data

To create the initial account, project and profile, do the following:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py create_and_import_data
```

And run the following command to populate your database with a tree of
org units (these are childcare schools in the West of DRC):

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py tree_importer \
    --org_unit_csv_file testdata/schools.csv \
    --data_dict testdata/data_dict.json \
    --source_name wb_schools_2019 \
    --version_number=1 \
    --project_id=1\
     --main_org_unit_name maternelle
```

You can now login on `http://localhost:8081`

Alternatively to this step and following steps you can import data from DHIS2 see section below.

### 8. Create a form

Run the following command to create a form:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py create_form
```

At this point, if you want to edit forms directly on your machine using
Enketo, go to the Enketo setup section of this README (down below).

Once you are done, you can click on the eye for your newly added form,
click on "+ Create", tap a letter, then enter, select the org unit, then
click "Create instance".

If Enketo is running and well setup, you can fill the form now.

### 9. Create other cool stuff

You can now start to develop additional features on Iaso!


### 10. Import OrgUnit, Forms and Submission from DHIS2

Alternatively or in addition to steps 7-8, you can import data from the DHIS2 demo server (play.dhis2.org).

By running the command


``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose run --rm iaso manage seed_test_data --mode=seed --dhis2version=2.35.3
```

The hierarchy of OrgUnit, group of OrgUnit, Forms, and their Submissions will be imported. Type of OrgUnit are not
handled at the moment

you can then log in through <http://127.0.0.1:8081/dashboard> with :

 -   user : testemail2.35.3
 -   password: testemail2.35.3

### 11. Activating the Polio plugin

Create a file `plugins/polio/js/.env` with the content

```env
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
PUBLIC_URL=/static/polio
APP_ENV=local%
```

in your root .env set
```PLUGIN_POLIO_ENABLED=true```

 
Run commands inside the docker
-------------------------------

Each docker container uses the entrypoint.


The `entrypoint.sh` script offers a range of commands to start services or
run commands. The full list of commands can be seen in the script. The
pattern to run a command is
`docker-compose run <container-name> <entrypoint-command> <...args>`

The following are some examples:

* Run tests                    `docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py test`
* Create a shell inside the container    `docker-compose run iaso bash`
* Run a shell command          `docker-compose run iaso eval curl http://google.com`
* Run Django manage.py         `docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py help`
* Launch a python shell        `docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py shell
* Launch a postgresql shell    `docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py dbshell`
* Create pending ORM migration files `docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py makemigrations`
* Apply pending ORM migrations `docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py migrate`
* Show ORM migrations          `docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py showmigrations`

Containers and services
-----------------------

The list of the main containers:

*  iaso       The python backend in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
*  webpack    The JS frontend in react
*  db         [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database

All the container definitions for development can be found in the
`docker-compose.yml`.

> **note**
>
> Postgresql uses Django ORM models for table configuration and
> migrations.


### note : docker-compose run VS docker-compose exec

Run launch a new docker container, Exec launch a command it the existing container.

So `run` will ensure the dependencies like the database are up before executing. `exec` main advantage is that it is faster
but the containers must already be running (launched manually) 

`run` will launch the entrypoint.sh script but exec will take a bash command to run which is why if you want
to run the django manage.py you will need to use `run iaso manage` but `exec iaso ./manage.py`

Also take care that `run` unless evoked with the `--rm` will leave you with a lot of left over containers that take up
disk space and need to be cleaned occasionally with `docker-compose rm` to reclaim disk space.

Enketo
------

To enable the Enketo editor in your local environment, you will have to
install our fork of enketo-express:

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
git clone https://github.com/BLSQ/enketo.git
cd setup/docker
docker-compose up
```

Then, you need to make sure your .env file is properly configured.
ENKETO_URL should be set to http://192.168.1.15:81 (Replace
192.168.1.15 by your host)

To seed your DB with typical example forms, see the  Import data from DHIS2 section

Enketo and Iaso will each run separately in their own  docker-compose but still need to communicate together.
This is done via your host, which is why you will need to change the IP in .env each time your ip change.

TODO: This setup should be simplified a bit

Database restore and dump
-------------------------

To create a copy of your iaso database in a file (dump) you can use:
```
docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres iaso  -Fc > iaso.dump
```

The dumpfile will be created on your host. The `-Fc` meant it will use an optimised Postgres format (which take less place). If you want the plain sql command use `-Fp`

To restore a dump file that you made or that somebody sent you:
```
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "create database iaso5"
cat iaso.dump | docker-compose exec -T db pg_restore -U postgres -d iaso5 -Fc --no-owner /dev/stdin
```

This will put the data in a database called iaso5. You can choose in your .env file which database is used by editing
the `RDS_DB_NAME` settings.


Contributing
============

Code formatting
---------------

We have adopted Black [](https://github.com/psf/black) as our code
formatting tool. Line length is 120.

The easiest way to use is is to install the pre-commit hook: 1. Install
pre-commit: pip install pre-commit 2. Execute pre-commit install to
install git hooks in your .git/ directory.

Another good way to have it working is to set it up in your code editor.
Pycharm, for example, has good support for this.

The pre-commit is not mandatory but Continuous Integration will check
if the formatting is respected!

Tests and linting
-----------------

For python, we use django builtin test framework. Tests can be executed with

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker-compose exec iaso ./manage.py test
```

Code reloading
--------------

In development the servers will reload when they detect a file
change, either in Python or Javascript. 

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you need to restart everything
``` {.sourceCode .shell}
docker-compose stop && docker-compose start
```

If you encounter problems, you can try to rebuild everything from
scratch.

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
# kill containers
docker-compose kill
# remove `iaso` container
docker-compose rm -f iaso
# build containers
docker-compose build
# start-up containers
docker-compose up
```


React Intl
----------

It often blocks the deployment.

you can test the default message extraction with

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
# make sure you commit everything
npm run webpack-prod
git clean -n
git clean -f ..
```

Jupyter Notebook
----------------

To run a Jupyter Notebook, just copy the env variable from runaisasdev.sh, activate the virtualenv and run

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
python manage.py shell_plus --notebook
```

Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk
====================================

See also [HOW-TO-DEPLOY.md](HOW-TO-DEPLOY.md)

Running Django 3 on Elastic Beanstalk
-------------------------------------

Django 3 requires version 2+ of the gdal library. Sadly, Beanstalk is
based on Amazon Linux that can only install gdal 1 from the epel
repository. To be able to use gdal 2, first identify the AMI of the
Elastic Beanstalk EC2 server. In EC2, launch a new instance based on
that AMI. In the instance, run (based on
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49637407/deploying-a-geodjango-application-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk>
and adapted to use /usr instead of /usr/local): (For Amazon Linux 2, use
geos-3.5.2)

> wget <http://download.osgeo.org/geos/geos-3.4.2.tar.bz2> tar xjf
> geos-3.4.2.tar.bz2 cd geos-3.4.2 ./configure --prefix=/usr make sudo
> make install cd ..
>
> wget <http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.1.tar.gz> wget
> <http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.5.tar.gz> tar xzf
> proj-4.9.1.tar.gz cd proj-4.9.1/nad tar xzf
> ../../proj-datumgrid-1.5.tar.gz cd .. ./configure --prefix=/usr make
> sudo make install cd ..
>
> sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel sudo yum -y update
>
> sudo yum install make automake gcc gcc-c++ libcurl-devel proj-devel
> geos-devel autoconf automake gdal cd /tmp
>
> curl -L <http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/2.2.3/gdal-2.2.3.tar.gz> | tar
> zxf -cd gdal-2.2.3/ ./configure --prefix=/usr --without-python
>
> make -j4 sudo make install
>
> sudo ldconfig

Then go to Actions -> Image -> Create Image When it's ready, go to the
Beanstalk Instance Settings and specify the AMI reference of the image
we just created.


Testing S3 uploads in development
---------------------------------

If you need to test s3 storage in development, you have to:

1.  Set the AWS\_STORAGE\_BUCKET\_NAME env variable to a bucket created
    for such tests
2.  Set the AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID and AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY env
    variables appropriately
3.  Set the USE\_S3 env variable to 'true'

These are actually exactly the same steps we use on AWS.

### Testing prod js assets in development
Run `TEST_PROD=true docker-compose up`

to have a local environment serving you the production assets (minified
and with the same compilation option as in production). This can be
useful to reproduce production only bugs.

# Workers


To execute task in the background, we use Elastic Beanstalk workers with
SQS using a fork of the library
[django-beanstalk-worker](https://pypi.org/project/django-beanstalk-worker/)
from tolomea. The endpoint `/api/copy_version/` is a good example of how
to create a task and to plug it to the api.

When calling a function with the @task decorator, it will add it to the
task queue. You are required to pass it a User objects, in addition to
the other function's argument, that represent which user is launching
the task. At execution time the task will receive a iaso.models.Task
instance in argument that should be used to report progress. It's
mandatory for the function, at the end of a successful execution to call
task.report_success() to mark its proper completion.

In local development you can call the url `tasks/run_all` which will run
all tasks in queue.
