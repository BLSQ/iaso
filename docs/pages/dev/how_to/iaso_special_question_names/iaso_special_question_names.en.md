# IASO special question names

On top of providing a way to receive the profile's value in follow-up forms (See [Create forms for entities](../create_forms_for_entities/create_forms_for_entities.en.md#follow-up-forms)), 
IASO has a few question names that are filled-in automatically.

The following are special question names.
