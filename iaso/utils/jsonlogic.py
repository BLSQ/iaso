# This is used to be able to force cast as json value into a float. Didn't find a simple way that would work
# with our django version. From Django version 4.0 We can apparently use lookup directly in filter which might simplfy
# things.
# With this by using a __forcefloat in a json field name it is cast as a double precision
# e.g:
# `Instance.objects.filter(json__usable_vials_physical__forcefloat__gte= 1)`

# /django/db/models/functions/datetime.py class Extract
# https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/custom-lookups-in-django-69fd13e35bdb

# Another alternative would have been to use an annotate in this way. But that complicate the filter flow because we
# would have to annotate every field we are casting for.
# Instance.objects.annotate(b=Cast(KeyTextTransform('usable_vials_physical', "json"), FloatField())).filter(b__gte=2)
