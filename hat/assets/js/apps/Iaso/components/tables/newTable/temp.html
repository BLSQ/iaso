<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>(Chief-Instructor IOGKF Belgium)</strong></p>
I was born at Mol on 7th February 1960. As a 13-year old boy I started Karate. Twice a week I went by bike to the
nearest
dojo. There I got training in "Kyokushinkai Karate". Friends of mine from the same village stopped rather quickly;
however
I was fascinated by this martial art. After three years my teacher met the Okinawan Master, Morio Higaonna Shihan, so
then
from 1976, I was lucky to start practicing "Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate". Prominent students, trained by Higaonna Shihan
(Sensei
Chinen, Sensei James Rousseau, Sensei Onaga, Sensei Suzuki) came, on repeated occasions, for training in our Belgian
Dojo’s.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-459" src="http://www.gojuryu.be/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pat1.jpeg" alt="pat1" width="493" height="480" /> In 1978 I passed my grading for Shodan. In 1979, the year that the IOGKF was
founded, I started my own Goju-Ryu Dojo. At
the beginning I taught twice a week. The club however grew very fast. A few years later, namely in 1982, we organized a
European
Gasshuku at Leopoldsburg. This was my first personal meeting with Master Morio Higaonna. Immediately I realized I would
not
be able to find a better Karate teacher. From that moment on I started training with still more dedication and
conviction.
The result was a 3rd place in the Flemish Kata championship "Team Kata" and a first place in the Belgian "Team Kata"
championship.
Since then, I have not participated anymore in competitions but I concentrated more on practicing "Traditional Okinawan
Goju-Ryu"
and on passing my knowledge to my students. In 1983 I passed my grading for Nidan, 1990 Sandan, 1999 Yondan and 2005
Godan.
In 1991 my Sensei, Pieter Harms, decided to leave the IOGKF. From that moment on "Traditional Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate"
in
Belgium fell apart. Every Sensei followed his own way. However I did not agree with this decision and decided to stay
with
Morio Higaonna Shihan. In 1993, I was asked to become Chief-Instructor of Belgium by Master Morio Higaonna. Since then I
completely realized how important it was to train as much as possible with Morio Higaonna Shihan and other
Senior-Instructors;
Bakkies Laubscher Sensei(South Africa), George Andrews Sensei(England), Ernie Molyneux Sensei (England), the late Harry
de
Spa Sensei and Sydney Leijenhorst Sensei (Netherlands) had already been our guests in Belgium. I want to say thanks to
them
again for their technical support. Further on I consider it as my task to pass my knowledge to my students so that they
can
grow in "Okinawan Goju-Ryu" as well. In 1995, during the European Gasshuku in Spain, my Sandan was confirmed by Morio
Higaonna
Shihan himself. August 1998, for the first time I met Miyagi An'ichi Sensei and Shuichi Aragaki Sensei. I was amazed by
their
knowledge, enthusiasm and kindness. It was also a unique opportunity to hear them talk about the history of "Traditional
Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate". Thank you Sensei, it was a unique experience to train with you. When you practice Okinawan
Goju-Ryu
it is almost a must to travel to the country of origin. The group of Senior-Sensei as well as the Okinawan population is
full of people with honest and warm hearts.

</a>

Now, after almost 37 years of karate, of which 34 years has been spent in Goju-Ryu, I would not be able to imagine my
life
without it: it is not only a martial art for me and my family but it has also become an important part of our life
philosophy.
My wife also practices Goju-Ryu Karate. 2009, the Honbu-dojo in Mol exists 30 years later. Also children from the age of
seven can practice Okinawan Goju-Ryu in our Dojo’s. Adults as well as children practice with a lot of dedication. Beside
the Honbu-dojo in Mol there are still four other Dojo’s in Belgium, for the time being, which practice "Traditional
Okinawan
Goju-Ryu Karate", namely:
<ul>
	<li>"Okinawa Goju-Ryu Arendonk": Ivo van Olmen Sensei</li>
	<li>“Okinawa Goju-Ryu Geel-Ten Aard”: Ivan Cools Sensei</li>
	<li>“Okinawa Goju-Ryu Nuclea”: Geert de Meyer Sensei</li>
	<li>"Okinawa Goju-Ryu Viersel": Ludo Huybrechts Sensei</li>
	<li>“Okinawa Goju-Ryu Brussel”: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Marc Sanglier Sensei</span></li>
</ul>
On the regional and the so-called executives-training, which are given by me on Sunday morning, the members of all the
Belgian
Dojo’s train together. This is to keep uniformity in our style. For the future, I hope that Okinawan Goju-Ryu will keep
growing
here in Belgium. In 1999 we organized the 17th European Gasshuku. It became a great success, thanks to the efforts of so
many. For me it was the first time that I, as Chief-Instructor, could welcome into Belgium, Morio Higaonna Shihan, many
other
Senior-Instructors and so many Karate-ka from all over the world. I must admit that after my daily work as a
hairdresser,
it is not always easy to give training in the evening (about 20 hours a week). The meeting with other Sensei has always
been
a stimulus for me, and my students too, to continue, still, with more conviction and dedication. I am convinced that a
Gasshuku
(even a small one), next to important technical value, has a not negligible spiritual stimulus to maintain. As Higaonna
Shihan
told us several times:
<em>"Never give up, you come and you'll grow!"</em>

Shihan and Bakkies Laubscher Shihan, who, up
to now, put their knowledge at our disposal and all of them who put their trust in me. I hope and I will always do my
utmost,
not to betray their confidence in me. Patrick Curinckx
