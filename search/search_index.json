IASO is recognized as a Digital Public Good by the Digital Public Good Alliance and listed as a Digital Square Software Global Good, a testament to its proven impact.</p> <p>IASO comprises:</p> <ul> <li>a web dashboard - intended for supervisors to organize data collection and geographical data management</li> <li>a mobile application that also works offline - intended to field users to fill out forms and send data when network is available</li> <li>a matching and scripting interface to analyze, compare and merge several geographic data sources</li> <li>a bi-directional integration with DHIS2, the widely used Health Management Information System in Low- and middle-income countries</li> </ul> <p>In terms of features, IASO can be summarized around three main components which are interconnected and expand the powers of one another:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Geospatial data management (Georegistry)</p> <ul> <li>Manage multiple master lists of organizational units (e.g. health areas, districts, facilities, or schools) including their GPS coordinates and boundaries</li> <li>Keep track of changes made to the organization units</li> <li>Map multiple geographic data sources</li> <li>Propose changes to org units from IASO mobile application and validate them on the web</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Structured data collection</p> <ul> <li>Create data collection forms using the widely known XLS form format and upload them to IASO</li> <li>Link your form to one or several organization unit type (e.g. National/Regional/District/Health facility) to geo-structure your data collection</li> <li>Keep track of changes with versioning of your data collection forms</li> <li>Validate from the web all data collection form submissions sent from IASO mobile application</li> <li>Monitor data collection completeness per organization unit level and drill-down to identify where issues happen</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Geo-enabled Microplanning</p> <ul> <li>Manage teams of users and teams of teams</li> <li>Assign data collection duties to teams and users using a map interface</li> <li>Create plannings with a scope, a time span, and one or several data collection form(s)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The platform has been implemented in Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda. It is the official georegistry in Burkina Faso since 2023. IASO has also been implemented at regional level (AFRO region) in support to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative for its geospatial and health facility registries capabilities.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#technical-stack","title":"Technical stack","text":"<p>IASO is made of a white labeled Android application using Java/Kotlin, reusing large parts of the ODK projects, and a web platform programmed using Python/GeoDjango on top of PostGIS. Frontend is mainly React/Leaflet. The API is implemented via Django rest framework, all data is stored in Postgresql or the media/ directory. One of the aims is the ease of integration with other platforms. We already have csv and geopackage imports and exports and target easy integration with OSM.</p> <p>The companion mobile app for Android allow submitting forms and creating org unit.</p> <p>Forms can also be filled in a web interface via the Enketo companion service. Both IASO and Enketo need to be configured to work together. It is possible to run an Enketo service locally.</p>"},{"location":"AWS-Deployment.html","title":"How Iaso is deployed on AWS","text":"<p>on ElasticBeanstalk + RDS </p>"},{"location":"AWS-Deployment.html#main-parts","title":"Main parts","text":"<ul> <li>Creation of the HOST environment where the Iaso code will be deployed as well as the related services</li> <li>The deployment of the code itself and of new version</li> </ul>"},{"location":"AWS-Deployment.html#host-infrastructure","title":"Host infrastructure","text":"<p>This documentation concerned the main Iaso deployment, that are done on AWS.</p> <p>The main pillar is AWS  Elastic beanstalk</p> <p>Which is kind of a magic solution from Amazon that tie several of their service together, handle deployment logic, etc...</p> <p>In the past we configured it by hands but now we are moving toward having it  all handled via Terrraform so it is in code (we can have an history, avoid misclick, do complex ops etc...).</p> <p>The technical term for this is \"Provisioning\" if you want to look it up.</p>"},{"location":"AWS-Deployment.html#setup-of-the-elastic-beainstalk","title":"Setup of the Elastic Beainstalk","text":"<p>See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-django.html</p> <p>We have custom commands and configuration in .ebextensions/ and in  and in .platform/ to extend the nginx config.</p>"},{"location":"AWS-Deployment.html#running-django-3-on-elastic-beanstalk-custom-ami","title":"Running Django 3 on Elastic Beanstalk / Custom AMI","text":"<p>Django 3 requires version 2+ of the gdal library.

Tenant are called and represented by the model <code>Account</code>. It represents roughly one client org or country. It also represents the natural limit of right for a user.</li> <li>Each Django's User has a linked Iaso <code>Profile</code> that link it to an <code>Account</code> and store extra parameters for the user.</li> <li>Each tenant can have multiple <code>Project</code>. Projects are linked to one android version App via the <code>app_id</code>. We use the link to control what a user can see from that app.</li> <li><code>DHIS2</code> is a standard server application and web UI in the industry to handle Health Data. Iaso can import and export data (forms and org unit) to it.</li> <li><code>OrgUnit</code> (Organizational Unit) is a Node of the GeoRegistry tree. e.g a particular Country, City or Hospital. each belonging to each other via a <code>parent</code> relationship.</li> <li>They can have a type <code>OrgUnitType</code> e.g. Country, City, Hospital</li> <li>they can belong to multiple <code>Group</code>, e.g. Urban Region or Campaign 2017</li> <li>DHIS2 has the concept of <code>Group</code> but not <code>Type</code> so when importing from a DHIS2 Instance all the type will be Unknown and OrgUnit will belong to group like <code>Clinic</code></li> <li><code>GroupSet</code> are Group of group. Used when we export Group to DHIS2</li> <li>OrgUnit may have a position in space, it can be an area, the  <code>geom</code> field is then used, or just a Point, the <code>location</code> field is then used.<ul> <li>It's technically possible to have both</li> <li>a OrgUnit may have no geographical info</li> <li>a OrgUnit may geographically be outside its parent.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>DataSource</code> links OrgUnit and Group imported from the same source, e.g a DHIS2 instance, a CSV or a GeoPackage.</li> <li>A <code>source_ref</code> on the imported instance is used to keep the reference from the original source, so we can match it again in the future (when updating the import or exporting it back)</li> <li><code>SourceVersion</code> is used to keep each version separated. e.g each time we import from DHIS2 we create a new version.</li> <li>OrgUnit (for their parent) and Group should only reference other OrgUnit and Group in the same version. (This is not enforced everywhere yet)</li> <li><code>Task</code> are asynchronous function that will be run by a background worker in production. eg: Importing Data from DHIS2. see Worker section below for more info.</li> <li><code>Form</code> is the definition of a Form (list of question and their presentation).<ul> <li>The model contain the metadata, the actual definition is done in a <code>XSLForm</code> as an attached file.</li> <li>Form are linked to one or more Project. This is used to know which Form are presented in the Mobile App.</li> <li>Form can have multiple versions</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>Instance</code> or Form instance is the <code>Submission</code> of a form. A form that has actually been filed by a user.<ul> <li>Instance can be GeoTagged and/or linked to a OrgUnit</li> <li>Note: We are moving to use Submission everywhere in the UI, but it is still in progress. please submit PR.</li> <li>Submission cannot be done via the Iaso UI itself but through Enketo or the Mobile App.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>APIImport</code> are used to log some request from the mobile app so we can replay them in case of error.

As such, Bluesquare acknowledges the importance of making Iaso as interoperable as possible in order to facilitate data exchange within the global digital health ecosystem such as the Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) community.</p>"},{"location":"pages/users/reference/interop/interop.html#open-standards-already-implemented","title":"Open standards already implemented","text":"<p>The below below standard technologies are already being used by Iaso today:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data collection: XLSForm, CSV</p> </li> <li> <p>Geographical data: geopackage</p> </li> </ul> <p>Iaso data collection can be done through forms in the common XLSForm format used for example by ODK, and allows to import and export data to DHIS2 (thanks to a user-friendly mapping interface), which is not per se using open formats in general, but is a de facto standard in some health topics, DHIS2 being probably the most installed open source health information management system.</p> <p>Iaso allows imports and exports of geographical data through the geopackage format (http://www.geopackage.org/) which is the relatively new golden standard for Geographical Information Systems.</p>"},{"location":"pages/users/reference/interop/interop.html#interoperability-roadmap","title":"Interoperability roadmap","text":"<p>1. Short-term (by end of 2023)</p> <ul> <li>DHIS2 Tracker data import/export</li> </ul> <p>Recently, we implemented case management features in Iaso, which is mainly the possibility to collect and store data about individuals. One goal will be to further develop the integration between Iaso and DHIS2 Tracker, to allow the import and export of data linked to individuals.</p> <ul> <li>FHIR</li> </ul> <p>In the same context as above, Bluesquare would ensure that Iaso is compatible with the FHIR standard for health care data exchange. That said, Iaso is a generic data collection tool, and consequently we can\u2019t enforce that collected data always uses a predefined set of fields. Consequently, support of FHIR for case management would be made on a project basis, and where Bluesquare could help is by providing documentation of how to implement some parts of the FHIR standard.</p> <p>On the other hand, Iaso is a very complete facility list management system and here, there is a very good opportunity to adopt OHIE facility registry standards. This will be studied by the end of the year and implemented if we can identify a project needing the feature.</p> <p>2. Long-term (end of 2023 and beyond)</p> <ul> <li>Better sharing of documentation about Iaso</li> </ul> <p>Iaso\u2019s code and general information is published on the dedicated Github repository that you can find here: https://github.com/BLSQ/iaso/wiki</p> <p>Bluesquare has started to organize processes to ensure more easily accessible documentation about Iaso, that will benefit the open source health softwares community. An evolving user guide will be made available on https://readthedocs.org/, together with more technical documentation on new features. A high-level roadmap on next features will also be published and maintained.</p> <p>To facilitate interoperability, we are in the process of publishing the api specification in the OpenAPI standard (the format used by the Swagger tool).</p> <ul> <li>Microplanning</li> </ul> <p>Iaso is growing more and more to be a planning system, e.g. for vaccination campaigns. We need to investigate if there are existing standards (outside of calendar standards like caldav) , especially in the OHIE specification that could be reused to expose our plannings to external systems.</p> <ul> <li>Logistics</li> </ul> <p>There is a growing demand for Iaso to be able to handle logistics, in order to monitor stocks of certain health-related or other supplies, such as vaccines, mosquito nets in certain locations. If Iaso would further develop features in this field, Bluesquare will make sure to follow the openHIE \u201cLogistics Management Information System (LMIS)\u201d and \u201cProduct Catalogue\u201d components principles.</p>"}]}
