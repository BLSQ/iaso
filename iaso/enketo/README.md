Enketo is another service, used to present Form to users, so they can use them. This document explain how to set it up
locally and how the connexion between the two works. 

This package contain utilities functions to interact with the ENKETO server. A part of the logic is in the API in `iaso/api/enketo.py`.
See main README for more information.

Iaso is compatible and tested with Enketo version 4 and 5.

# Running Enketo in you dev environment
See the Enketo directory section from the Main readme.md on how to launch Enketo in your docker compose environment. You shouldn't need any special configuration.

Iaso used to have a fork of Enketo to run in dev mode but nowadays, you can use the mainstream one at https://github.com/enketo/enketo-express


## Automatic data configuration in Iaso
To populate your Iaso database with Form and Org Unit, as well as sample submissions that you can use with your local Enketo, you can use the seed command. That will retrieve these information from the sample DHIS2 server.

First Run:
```
docker-compose  up

docker exec -it iaso_1 bash -c './manage.py seed_test_data --mode=seed --dhis2version=2.31.8'
```

Note that the content of the created Submission (in their "json" and "xml" ) don't match the provided xlsform. So the edit will "work", but the json will dramatically change.

Then in the Iaso Dashboard, got to the instance details of Quantity PCA form 2.31.8

Then in the FAB (Floating action button, on the top right) button you can Edit : Modifier les r√©ponses via enketo.

# API Endpoints:

* `/enketo/create` Iaso web: create submission. Logged user
* `/enketo/edit/<instance_uuid>/` Iaso web edit submission. Logger user with perm.
* `/enketo/create_public_url/` Used by external service. Edit or Create submission
* `/enketo/formList` Internal wiring, called by Enketo
* `/enketo/formDowload` Internal wiring, called by Enketo 
* `/enketo/submission/` Internal wiring, called by Enketo create the actual value
* `/fill/<form_uuid>/<org_unit_id>/<period>/` Not used at the moment


# public_create_url
This endpoint is used by web page outside of IASO to fill a form for an org unit and period.
It contacts enketo to generate a Form Webpage and return the url to that page

Used for example by the Invoice App

Different behaviours:

* form is single per period:
    1. No submission exist for period and org unit: Create a new one
    2. 1 submission exists, open Enketo to edit it.
    3. 2 or more for exist: Error state
* form !single_per_period
    1. Always create a new submission

The parameters are "in the dhis2 world" because (we don't know much about iaso db details)

```
    form_id=CS_QLTE_RDC003-Gestion_finance (the form_id not the technical id of the db)
    period=2022Q3 (in dhis2 format)
    external_user_id= dhis2 user id (an user/profile is created automatically)
    external_org_unit_id=DWmKNyyDCWv (source_ref of the iaso orgunit)
```

## Flow for `public_create_url`

    Note right of Browser: User open page to Submit form
    Browser->>DHIS2: open page
    DHIS2 -->> Browser: Link to /enketo/create_public_url with parameters

    Note right of IASO: Create Instance in db
    IASO ->> Enketo: POST /api_v2/survey/single
    Note over IASO,Enketo:If editing an existing Instance we do along with the form_id. Iaso will send an instance_id and an instance_xml containing the current answers.

    Enketo -->> IASO: json with $url to enketo
    IASO -->> DHIS2: json with $url
    Browser ->> Enketo: GET $url
    Enketo ->> IASO: GET /enketo/formList with the Instance uuid
    IASO -->> Enketo: Return a XML with a single URL to /api/enketo/formDownload/ with the uuid instance
    Enketo ->> IASO: GET /enketo/formDownload?uuid=..
    Note right of IASO: Take form definition, inject uuid in it.
    IASO -->> Enketo: Return modified XML Form definition
    Enketo -->> Browser: Return an HTML Page with a form to fill
    Note right of Browser: User fill the form, click submit
    Browser ->> Enketo: POST form with the submission
    Enketo ->> IASO: HEAD /enketo/submission to get max content size [0]
    IASO -->> Enketo: Return 204 with info in Header
    Enketo ->> IASO: POST /enketo/submssion with the submission

    opt if to_export
        Note right of IASO: Do mapping logic.
        IASO ->> DHIS2: POST mapped submission
        DHIS2 ->> IASO: return ok
        # if the instance fail to export we still save it in the Iaso database
        # to be exported later
    end
    IASO -->> Enketo: Return HTTP Status 201
    Enketo -->> Browser: HTTP redirect to return url
    # Return url is either passed at start of process or new submission page in iaso
    Browser --> IASO: Open redirected page
    Note right of Browser:  user is not authenticated in Iaso

# HOW TO manually test Enketo public_create_url

Ensure you have a usable project, form (with form version etc...) and an orgunit in iaso. And Enketo is working. You should be able to make a submission from the web interface. Do it to verify everything

Edit the Project in Django admin. And copy the external token
It's automatically generated, so you should always have one

`token='bdba9384-bcd7-4f39-a8e3-310f5ba309ee'`

Still in the admin, take the form_id on the Form (caution: this is an external id, a string, different from the form.id) You should have one if you uploaded a correct FormVersion

`form_id= 'FORM_A_Tool'`

On the OrgUnit take the external token: (it's in the dashboard)

`external_org_unit_id= "AO001000000000000000"`

Make an url with it:
```
f"/api/enketo/public_create_url/?period={period}&form_id={form_id}&token={token}&external_org_unit_id={external_org_unit_id}"

=> '/api/enketo/public_create_url/?period=202301&form_id=FORM_A_Tool&token=bdba9384-bcd7-4f39-a8e3-310f5ba309ee&external_org_unit_id=AO001000000000000000'
```

Iaso will return a json with a URL, open it.
Fill the form.

To test the export, add the `to_export=true` argument. You will need FormMapping and a DHIS2 configuration to test the full export

# Create and edit form from iaso
For the Edit in Enketo feature it use `/enketo/create/` and `/enketo/edit/<instance_uuid>/` instead of `/enketo/public_create_url/` . It behaves nearly in the same way but not 100% exactly. It's restricted to currently logged in user and embed the current user in the form definition. 

Other differences it take the internal iaso form_id and not the one from the XML, idem for Org Unit etc...

To confirm but normally from Step "4" to Step "14" in the flow diagram would be the same.

The export behave differently as it is handled by the Front End manually in a separate call.

# Old notes on implementations
Warning some part might not be up-to-date.

TODO : check which part are still relevant

## Implementation details

currently everything is in enketo.py and enketo_url.py

the client ask for edit url with the instance
we hide in the meta tags the editUserID with its id
the client redirect to enketo

instanceId is the uuid in meta.instanceID xml tag

when the user submit the modifoed form in enketo
it comes back to iaso with a new meta.instanceID
and the meta.deprecateID is filled with the previous uuid
we can find back the user based on the editUserId
we log modifications and store the new media files


## Reverse Engineering notes : Api calls from enketo

/enketo/formList/?formID=myformid

returns
```
<xforms xmlns="http://openrosa.org/xforms/xformsList">
	<xform>
		<formID>myformid</formID>
