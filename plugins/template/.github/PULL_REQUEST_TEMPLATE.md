## Self proofreading checklist

- [ ] Did I use eslint and ruff formatters?
- [ ] Is my code clear enough and well documented?
- [ ] Are my typescript files well typed?
- [ ] New translations have been added or updated if new strings have been introduced in the frontend
- [ ] My migrations file are included
- [ ] Are there enough tests?
- [ ] Documentation has been included (for new feature)

## Doc

Tell us where the doc can be found (docs folder, wiki, in the code...).

## Changes

Explain the changes that were made.

The idea is not to list exhaustively all the changes made (GitHub already provides a full diff), but to help the reviewers better understand:

- which specific file changes go together, e.g: when creating a table in the front-end, there usually is a config file that goes with it
- the reasoning behind some changes, e.g: deleted files because they are now redundant
- the behaviour to expect, e.g: tooltip has purple background color because the client likes it so, changed a key in the API response to be consistent with other endpoints

## How to test

Explain how to test your PR.

If a specific config is required explain it here: dataset, account, profile, etc.

## Print screen / video

Upload here print screens or videos showing the changes.

## Notes

Things that the reviewers should know:

- known bugs that are out of the scope of the PR
- other trade-offs that were made
- does the PR depends on a PR in [bluesquare-components](https://github.com/BLSQ/bluesquare-components)?
- should the PR be merged into another PR?
