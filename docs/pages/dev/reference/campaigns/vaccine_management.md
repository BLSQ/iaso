# Vaccine Management in IASO

**Vaccine Stock Management & Supply Chain Documentation**

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed explanation of how the vaccine stock management and supply chain modules function in our backend system, focusing on how vaccine totals are calculated at various stages. This guide is intended for both technical and non-technical audiences to understand how vaccine supplies are managed from request to distribution.

The vaccine management system is split into two main modules: **Stock Management** and **Supply Chain**. The **Stock Management** module deals with tracking vaccines at warehouses, including incidents that might affect stock, while the **Supply Chain** module tracks the movement of vaccines from the time they are ordered until they arrive. Additionally, the system provides several **dashboard endpoints** that aggregate and display the relevant data, ensuring that stakeholders have an up-to-date overview of the vaccine inventory.

## Data Models and Structure

The system uses a variety of data models to store information about vaccines. Here are some of the key models:

1. **Vaccine Request Form (VaccineRequestForm)**: This form holds the details of the vaccine requests made by countries or regions. It keeps track of all the related information such as the total number of vaccine doses requested, shipped, and received.

    - **Total Doses Shipped**: The total doses shipped are calculated by summing the `doses_shipped` field from all linked `VaccinePreAlert` records.
    - **Total Doses Received**: The total number of doses received is calculated by summing the `doses_received` field from all linked `VaccineArrivalReport` records.

2. **Vaccine Pre-Alert (VaccinePreAlert)**: This record indicates when a shipment of vaccines is on the way. It includes information such as the `doses_shipped`, the estimated time of arrival, and lot numbers.

3. **Vaccine Arrival Report (VaccineArrivalReport)**: This record confirms the arrival of vaccines and includes the `doses_received`.

4. **Incident Reports (IncidentReport)**: Incidents that affect stock, such as losses, returns, or breakages, are recorded here. These incidents play a crucial role in updating stock counts.

5. **Destruction Reports (DestructionReport) and Outgoing Movements (OutgoingStockMovement)**: These models are used to manage vaccines that are discarded or moved out of storage for distribution. These records impact the overall stock and are essential for tracking reductions in stock.

6. **Vaccine Stock (VaccineStock)**: This model represents the current stock of vaccines for a specific account and country.

## Stock Management Module: Tracking Inventory

The **Stock Management Module** is responsible for managing vaccine stocks after they have been received into storage, such as at warehouses or distribution centers.

### Tracking Totals in Stock

To track the current stock, the system records all incoming and outgoing vaccine doses and uses these to calculate current totals.

-   **Usable Stock**: The number of doses available for use is tracked by counting all received vials minus any losses or other incident-related adjustments.
-   **Unusable Stock**: This includes any doses that are reported as expired, broken, or lost due to other incidents. The system sums up these unusable doses and keeps them separate from the usable stock.

### Incident Reports and Their Impact

Incidents such as broken vials or expired vaccines reduce the total available stock. The system maintains details of every incident, such as the number of unusable vials and their impact on the overall vaccine inventory.

For example, if there is a report of 50 broken vials, and each vial contains 10 doses, the system calculates 500 unusable doses and removes them from the usable stock.

### Dashboard Endpoints for Stock Management

The system includes endpoints that are used to display stock data on dashboards. These endpoints provide summaries, such as stock-in-hand and incidents summary, allowing stakeholders to quickly understand the available stock and recent incidents affecting vaccine inventory.

Key endpoints include:

-   `/api/polio/stock/stock_in_hand/`: Provides a summary of current stock levels.
-   `/api/polio/stock/incidents_summary/`: Summarizes recent incidents affecting stock.

These endpoints aggregate data from the `VaccineStock`, `IncidentReport`, and `DestructionReport` models to provide up-to-date information on stock levels and incidents.

## Supply Chain Module: Managing the Flow of Vaccines

The **Supply Chain Module** tracks vaccines as they are shipped to their final destinations. This includes everything from the initial shipment notification (pre-alert) to when the vaccines arrive and are confirmed.

### Pre-Alerts

A pre-alert is a record that a shipment is on its way. This helps stakeholders be prepared to receive the vaccines. It includes details such as the estimated arrival time and number of doses.

The pre-alert information is used to keep track of vaccines in transit and estimate future availability.

### Arrival Reports

When vaccines arrive at their destination, an arrival report is created to confirm how many doses actually arrived.

If any discrepancy exists between the doses shipped (in the pre-alert) and the doses received (in the arrival report), the system calculates the difference and marks it for review.

### Dashboard Endpoints for Supply Chain

Several endpoints are used to support dashboards displaying supply chain metrics. These endpoints provide data on shipment status, arrival times, and discrepancies. By aggregating data from pre-alerts and arrival reports, stakeholders can view up-to-date shipment statuses and quickly identify any issues in the supply chain.

Key endpoints include:

-   `/api/polio/vaccine/request_forms/`: Provides a list of all vaccine request forms.
-   `/api/polio/vaccine/pre_alerts/`: Lists all pre-alerts for incoming vaccine shipments.
-   `/api/polio/vaccine/arrival_reports/`: Shows all arrival reports for received vaccine shipments.

These endpoints aggregate data from the `VaccineRequestForm`, `VaccinePreAlert`, and `VaccineArrivalReport` models to provide comprehensive information on the supply chain status.

## Example Calculation: From Shipment to Stock

To make things clearer, let's walk through a typical scenario involving all key models:

1. **Vaccine Request Form**: A country submits a request for 10,000 doses of vaccine using a `VaccineRequestForm`.
2. **Pre-Alert**: A `VaccinePreAlert` is created in the system, indicating that 10,000 doses are being shipped.
3. **Arrival Report**: On arrival, a `VaccineArrivalReport` is created that notes that only 9,800 doses have been received. The system automatically calculates that there is a shortfall of 200 doses, which needs to be reconciled.
4. **Incident Report**: If some of the received vials are found to be damaged, say 100 vials containing 10 doses each, these are marked as unusable in an `IncidentReport`, resulting in 1,000 doses being deducted from the usable stock.
5. **Outgoing Stock**: After checking the stock, `OutgoingStockMovement` records are created to distribute 1,000 doses to health facilities. This is recorded to reflect the movement of vaccines out of the central storage.
6. **Destruction Report**: A `DestructionReport` records that 200 vials expired during storage, which further impacts the usable stock.
7. **Final Stock Calculation**: Initially shipped doses were 10,000. After arrival, usable doses were noted to be 9,800. After adjusting for incidents (1,000 unusable doses) and accounting for outgoing movements and destructions, the total usable doses are now 7,600.

## Summary

-   **Stock Management** handles everything related to vaccines in storage, tracking usable and unusable doses through the `VaccineStock`, `IncidentReport`, and `DestructionReport` models.
-   **Supply Chain** manages vaccine movement, from shipment notifications (`VaccinePreAlert`) to confirming receipt (`VaccineArrivalReport`).
-   **Dashboard Endpoints** provide stakeholders with visual and data-based summaries of vaccine stocks and supply chain statuses, aggregating data from various models.
-   Totals are calculated by adding received doses (from `VaccineArrivalReport`) and subtracting doses lost due to incidents (`IncidentReport`) or discrepancies in arrival.

These processes ensure that all stakeholders have an accurate picture of the vaccine inventory at every stage, from initial shipment to final distribution.

###Â Vials Received

Calculated by summing up all the vials received from VaccineArrivalReports. The method `get_vials_received()` in the VaccineStockCalculator class iterates through the list of vaccines received and sums up the 'vials_in' values.

### Vials Used

Calculated by summing up all the vials used from OutgoingStockMovements. The method `get_vials_used()` in the VaccineStockCalculator class iterates through the list of used vials and sums up the 'vials_in' values.

### Stock of usable vials

Calculated by the `get_total_of_usable_vials()` method in the VaccineStockCalculator class. It considers all movements of usable vials, including incoming (vials_in) and outgoing (vials_out) movements. The total is the sum of all incoming vials minus the sum of all outgoing vials.

### Stock of unusable vials

Calculated by the `get_total_of_unusable_vials()` method in the VaccineStockCalculator class. Similar to usable vials, it considers all movements of unusable vials, including incoming (vials_in) and outgoing (vials_out) movements. The total is the sum of all incoming unusable vials minus the sum of all outgoing unusable vials.

### Vials destroyed

Calculated by the `get_vials_destroyed()` method in the VaccineStockCalculator class. It sums up all the unusable vials destroyed as recorded in DestructionReports associated with the VaccineStock.

### Stock balance

The stock balance is calculated using the `/api/polio/vaccine/vaccine_stock/{id}/summary/` endpoint. This endpoint returns a JSON object with the following key fields

### Usable vials

Calculated by the `get_total_of_usable_vials()` method in the VaccineStockCalculator class. This method computes the difference between all incoming and outgoing usable vials, considering various stock movements such as arrivals, usage, and corrections.

### Unusable vials

Calculated by the `get_total_of_unusable_vials()` method in the VaccineStockCalculator class. Similar to usable vials, this method computes the difference between all incoming and outgoing unusable vials, considering incidents, destructions, and other relevant stock movements.

### Usable doses

Derived from the total_usable_vials. The number of doses is calculated by multiplying the number of usable vials by the doses per vial for the specific vaccine type. This conversion is handled within the VaccineStockCalculator class.

### Unusable doses

Derived from the total_unusable_vials. The number of unusable doses is calculated by multiplying the number of unusable vials by the doses per vial for the specific vaccine type. This conversion is also handled within the VaccineStockCalculator class.

These calculations take into account all relevant stock movements, including arrivals, usage, incidents, and destructions, providing a comprehensive view of the current vaccine stock status.
