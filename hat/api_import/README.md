This App is used to log API calls in the DB.

The idea is that the mobile app user may not have great internet connection where they are
so in case of import problem we can fix it server side and not ask them to upload again.

* API endpoint to be logged as such are decorated with the `@safe_api_import` decorator.
* The request themselves are stored in the `vector_control.APIImport` model.
* To replay the failings requests use the django command `reimport_failed_imports.py`


This app used to be a lot of others things too before, hence the not matching name.
