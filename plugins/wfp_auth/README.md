Reconciliation with existing user is done via their email address (not yet implemented)

## User Flow
1. User click login via WFP button in IASO (POST to `/accounts/wfp/login/`)
2. The user authenticate through CIAM
3. Callback to IASO ( GET `/accounts/wfp/login/callback/` with params)
4. Attempt reconciliation to an account via the email address
   1. If the user exist, login (if user is already created manually or via a bulk import)
   2. If the user doesn't exist, create it with no group or permissions. These will be added later per an admin (add a message to tell the user that he needs an admin to give the permissions). An email will be sent to EMAIL_RECIPIENTS_NEW_ACCOUNT to tell them to add permissions.
5. Authenticate the user in the platform


Information taken from CIAM:
* Email (used for reconciliation and default username)
* First Name
* Last Name

The email is validated in CIAM but not the first and last name so special care
should be done around identity thief.

Once a user has made an account via CIAM they can also reset their password,
allowing them to look via regular login password even if their CIAM account get blocked.


## Settings
The following environment variables are used for configuration (see corporate password vault for dev access):
* `WFP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`
this is provided by the CIAM team. The secret key is not needed

* `WFP_AUTH_ACCOUNT`
To which iaso account to attach the user

* `WFP_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS_NEW_ACCOUNT`
List of email adress, that will be contacted when a new account is created. Can be a list separated by a `,` 

The secret is not needed anymore.
